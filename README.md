**Robo Eyes**

This project uses the Robo Eyes project by Flux Garage - 'https://github.com/FluxGarage/RoboEyes'
and modifies it to use the TFT_eSPI library with a custom driver instead of the the Adafruit GFX library
with the SSD-1306 driver. 

The driver used in this project - rm67162

Planning to add more features as well.
